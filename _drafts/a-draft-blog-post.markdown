To preview your site with drafts, simply run jekyll serve or jekyll build with the --drafts switch. Each will be assigned the value modification time of the draft file for its date, and thus you will see currently edited drafts as the latest posts.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_drafts` directory that follows the convention: name-of-post.ext.
