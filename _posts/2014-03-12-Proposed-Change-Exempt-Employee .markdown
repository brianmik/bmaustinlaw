The Obama administration is [proposing][NYT cite] changes to labor laws that define "exempt employees" in an effort to 
increase the number of workers eligible for mandatory overtime pay. Under current law, employers may be exempt from paying overtime to 
employees if the employee receives a minimum salary or performs "executive" or supervisory functions.  

As described, the administration could increase the minimum salary required for exempt-employee status, and also impose a minimum percentage 
of time for executive-type services. Until an executive order is issued, it is not clear how any such percentage method would be implemented. 
Businesses with exempt employees may want to review current employment policies and consider altering existing employment arrangements in order 
to avoid potential disruptions if current labor laws are changed.
