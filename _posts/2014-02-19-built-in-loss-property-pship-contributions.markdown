The IRS has published [proposed regulations][prop regs cite] under Internal Revenue Code Section 704(c), which generally provides a backstop 
aimed at preventing non-contributing partners from benefiting from built-in loss property contributed to the partnership. This Code provision is 
particularly important for real estate partnerships, which often issue interests in the partnership in exchange for the contribution of real
estate.  

The proposed regulations are complicated, but it should be noted that they require that a partnership decrease its basis in contributed built-in 
loss property (to fair market value). The partnership must then allocate any future cost recoveries (i.e., depreciation or amortization) with 
respect to the contributed property in accordance with the allocation rules (generally, according to the partnership agreement) and any future 
cost recoveries with respect to the basis adjustment to the contributing partner. The proposed regulations also impose a notice requirement for 
partnerships in receipt of contributed built-in loss property.  

The preamble to the proposed regulations states that the IRS considered applying these new rules to "reverse" Section 704(c) allocations, but 
declined to do so due to administrative complexity. The proposed regulations will be effective when they are published as final in the Federal 
Register.
