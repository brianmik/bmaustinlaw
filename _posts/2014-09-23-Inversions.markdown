The IRS [announced][Announcement link] that it is issuing new rules targeting companies that expatriate through "inversion" transactions. In general, an "inversion" 
transaction occurs where: (i) a foreign company acquires the business or substantially all of the assets of a US business, (2) the shareholders of the old US company end 
up owning at least 60 percent of the shares of the new foreign company, and (3) less than 25 percent of the new multinational's business activity is in the home country 
of the new foreign parent. The new rules will apply only to inversion transactions where the shareholders in (2) above hold at least 60, but less than 80, percent of the 
new foreign company, as the existing tax laws completely disregard the non-US situs of the new foreign company in such 80-percent transactions.  

US companies considering an inversion transaction should consider the following:

## Would an inversion still grant access to CFC-retained earnings?  

Companies often have non-US subsidiaries, or "controlled foreign corporations" ("CFCs") under the tax rules, with retained earnings not yet taxed in the US. A common 
incentive to move offshore is access to these earnings without payment of US tax. A typical inversion, however, doesn't provide broad, tax-free access to these CFC 
earnings, as any CFC distribution to the new foreign parent would have to travel via the "sandwiched" US company. However, "inverted" companies commonly access these earnings 
without the payment of US tax using a couple of approaches:  

First, the CFC could buy stock of the new foreign parent ("hook stock") or make a "hopscotch" loan to the new foreign parent--either of which would trigger taxes if such 
stock purchase or loan was made with respect to the US company as a CFC investment in US property. The new rules will begin to characterize these hook stock and "hopscotch" 
loans as investments in US property (notwithstanding the non-US situs of the foreign parent) under an existing general anti-avoidance rule.  

Under another approach, the new foreign parent would use a "de-controlling" strategy to acquire the CFC stock, making the CFC a "sibling entity" to the US company. However, 
the IRS has stated under the new rules it will disregard the "de-controlling" transaction and perpetually treat the new foreign parent as owning the CFC through the US 
company.  

Finally, the new IRS rules will close a loophole that may have previously permitted access to CFC-retained earnings through a complicated "sale" of the US company to the 
CFC in a complicated, post-inversion, tax-free reorganization.  

## Could I still meet the less-than-80-percent requirement?  

As stated above, the IRS can completely ignore the non-US situs of a new foreign parent if at least 80 percent of the former US shareholders own the foreign parent post-
inversion. The new rules will change the way that this 80-percent threshold is measured.  

First, the IRS will disregard stock of the foreign parent attributable to passive assets, making it more difficult to "engineer" a less-than-80-percent ownership by 
pumping the foreign parent with cash and similar assets. On the other hand, the IRS will disregard certain transactions aimed to "slim" the US company pre-inversion 
through extraordinary distributions.  

## Conclusion  

The administration has expressed its frustration with expatrations by multinational businesses, and these rules will reduce the available tax benefit attributable to such 
expatriations. However, many smaller US-owned businesses that conduct a large amount of business abroad will also be limited by these rules, as they may become less able to 
operate across multiple non-US jurisdictions without paying hefty US taxes. While proper tax planning at initial formation is critical, these new rules further increase 
the importance of such planning, as they make the initial business structure more permanent and "irreversible" notwithstanding change to the underlying business.
