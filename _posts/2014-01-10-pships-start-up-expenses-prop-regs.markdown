The IRS has issued [proposed regulations][prop regs cite] aimed to curtail potential abuses by taxpayers taking
the position that a "technical termination" of a partnership triggers an immediate deduction of unamortized start-up and organizational
expenses.  

Taxpayers are generally required to amortize start-up and organizational expenses over a 15-year period (after taking an immediate deduction for
the first $5,000 of these costs). However, some taxpayers have taken the position that a partnership "technical termination"
(under Code Section 708(b)(1)(B)) constitutes a liquidation of the business and triggers an acceleration of previously unamortized amounts.
Partnership tax professionals understand that a "technical termination"--which generally occurs upon the sale or exchange of at least 50-percent
of the partnership interests--is a non-event for most tax purposes. Accordingly, this position has been viewed as aggressive, particularly
in light of existing regulations that require the continued amortization of Section 197 intangibles in these "technical termination" transactions.  

The [proposed regulations][prop regs cite] liken the amortization of start-up and organizational expenses to Section 197 intangibles and
explicitly prohibit their acceleration following a partnership "technical termination." These regulations will be effective as of
December 9, 2013, once they are finalized. However, partnerships that have taken a contrary position with respect to "technical terminations"
preceding that date should consider amending open returns, as the IRS is likely to these rules to be a clarification of existing law,
rather than a change.
