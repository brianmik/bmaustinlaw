Ellos is an upstart alternative online social network that differentiates itself by promising never to display paid advertisements or to sell its users' personal 
information. Last week, [Ello announced][Announcement link] that it has enshrined those promises into its corporate constitutional documents while simultaneously 
converting into a Delaware "Public Benefit Corporation" (or, "benefit corporation"). As a result, Ello is now required by law to adhere to these promises, which raises 
interesting questions about the benefits and burdens of benefit corporation status.    

## What are the requirements of benefit corporations?  

Benefit corporations are generally required to identify and attempt to generate public benefits, which are societal benefits separate from the goal of rewarding 
shareholders financially. Ello identified as public benefits an ad-free experience and the guaranty that user information remain private and revocable by the user. Under law, 
a shareholder or director of Ello could sue the company if they felt those public benefits were not being pursued properly.  

## Does a company benefit from "benefit corporation" status?  

Primarily, companies benefit indirectly from status as a benefit corporation, through signaling to potential customers and certain social investors that they are 
committed to their mission.  Benefit corporations do not, for example, receive any kind of federal tax benefit from their legal entity status. However, directors and officers 
of the corporation are subject to a lower level of scrutiny with respect to generating shareholder wealth, provided they were guiding the company toward its stated missions.  

## Why would Ello convert to a benefit corporation now?

The timing of Elllo's conversion to a benefit corporation coincides with a large financing from investors that share Ello's mission and goals. This is not accidental, but 
most likely indicates that Ello management believes it will no longer need additional financing, or alternatively, that Ello can seek any additional financing from the same 
or similarly mission-aligned investors. Traditional investors may shy away from benefit corporations as unable to generate the revenues to pay back investors, but Ello will 
be an important test case in determining how benefit corporation status affects a venture's ability to raise funds.
