As an annual tradition, Congress passes a package of tax breaks that typically last 1 to 2 years and have come to be known as the “tax extenders.” That package includes a tax break for certain sales of “qualified small business stock” under Section 1202 of the tax code. Prior to the Great Recession, up to $10 million of gain on sales of qualified small business stock were eligible for 50% gain exclusion, but the other 50% — the taxed half — became ineligible for long-term capital gains rates. (Also, the excluded half was subject to the alternative minimum tax.) As a result, the blended tax rate on gains from QSBS was about the same as the tax rate on sales of non-QSBS, making Section 1202 largely dead wood.

Then, to stimulate the economy, Congress enhanced the Section 1202 exclusion by increasing the excluded portion to 75%. Unsatisfied, Congress increased the exclusion to 100% and removed the alternative minimum tax application. As a result, many founders and early investors qualify for a zero tax rate on gains from their corporate ventures and investments. If this seems shocking, it’s most likely because Section 1202 imposes a 5-year holding period requirement, and September 29, 2015 was the first date that 100%-exclusion QSBS could be sold tax-free (assuming such QSBS was purchased on the first qualifying day). In other words, very few people have yet had direct experience with the full exclusion and no tax returns reflecting this exclusion have yet been filed.

Nevertheless, Congress felt confident of the benefits of 100% exclusion (and unconcerned of any deleterious effect on the deficit) and today made the provision permanent. President Obama has indicated he will sign the legislation.

People can debate the merits of a tax provision that complete absolves shareholders of tax when they founded the venture or invested very early seed capital. Section 1202, however, applies to all investors that come in before the corporation’s assets exceed $50 million — not a small amount. So, at a time when many Americans are upset about the carried interest “loophole” granting private equity and hedge fund managers a 23.8% rate, Congress has granted a 0.0% tax rate to a privileged subset of venture capital investors.


Treasury has reversed course on minimum "floor" allocations in proposed revisions to the partnership tax regulations. Often, partnerships (and LLCs taxed as partnerships) 
allocate a percentage of their income to a particular partner, but provide a minimum allocation amount. Current IRS regulations bless these allocations 
by explicitly providing that the entire allocation is treated as the partner's "distributive share" of partnership income if the "floor" is surpassed by the percentage 
amount. The current rules state that "guaranteed payment" treatment results only to the extent that the minimum "floor" is triggered. However, the IRS is proposing contrary 
treatment in newly proposed regulations that addressing private equity management fee waivers (a different but related issue).  

## Distributive Shares versus Guaranteed Payments     

Some partners aren't affected by the distinction between "distributive share" and "guaranteed payment" characterization, particularly where the partnership produces 
ordinary income (e.g., service partnerships). However, partners in capital asset partnerships (e.g., real estate holding LLCs) may benefit by receiving a "distributive 
share" of partnership income, where such partnership income constitutes lower-taxed long-term capital gains.  

## What Change is the IRS Proposing?     

In [proposed regulations][FR link], the IRS would characterize a "floor" allocation as a "guaranteed payment" to the extent of the minimum floor amount, regardless of the 
overall allocation. Presumably, amounts in excess of the floor would retain their "distributive share" characterization.  

## When is the Change Effective?     

It is not clear when this regulatory change will be effective, because the proposed regulations specifically address effectiveness with respect to the other revisions 
targeting management fee waivers. Therefore, partnerships (and LLCs taxed as partnerships) may want to consider revising any existing "floor" allocations in their 
agreements. Furthermore, many organizations may have longstanding "floor" allocations that were important in the organization's early stages and that have consistently 
been exceeded as a result of increases in the organization's income. Absent a revision, affected partners could experience a partial change in the characterization of their 
allocations, and therefore, a potential increase in taxes.  

Partnerships that have implemented "floor" allocations should speak with their tax advisors about the possible effect of these proposed regulations.
