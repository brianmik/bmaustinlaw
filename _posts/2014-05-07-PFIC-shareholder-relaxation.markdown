In [Notice 2014-18,][Notice link] the IRS announced that it will amend regulations under the Code sections affecting 
"passive foreign investment companies," or "PFICs," to exempt certain owners or beneficiaries of tax-exempt entities or 
accounts from treatment as PFIC shareholders with respect to any PFICs owned by such tax-exempt entities or accounts.  

In general, the Code imposes onerous tax and reporting obligations on non-US corporations that are characterized as PFICs and their 
shareholders. Congress enacted the PFIC rules in order to target inappropriate offshoring of income-generating assets by US persons. 
However, the PFIC rules were written so broadly that early stage companies can often be characterized as PFICs, particularly companies 
with IP as a high proportion of their assets.  

While this recent guidance does not carve back at the broad definition of a PFIC, it does provide some relief to certain individuals holding 
an indirect interest in a potential PFIC through an IRA or other tax-exempt entity or account. In that sense, the proposed revisions to the 
regulations are a welcome change to the PFIC rules.
