Partnerships and LLCs treated as partnerships (for US federal income tax purposes) have the ability to issue one of the most effective forms of 
equity incentive compensation--profits interests. While profits interests can be structured to shift relatively significant portions of a 
business enterprise in a tax-efficient manner (see "Catch-Up Allocations," below), they can be very complex and their terms are often 
misunderstood. Much of this complexity derives from the way in which profits interests differ from more-common stock options, and also from 
the flexibility and options that are available in designing profits interests. In my experience, managing partners, LLC managers, and profits 
interest recipients are most likely to misconstrue these elements:  

## When exactly does the profits interest recipient become entitled to distributions?  

In general, profits interests share in the post-issuance growth of the enterprise. This means that a profits interest could participate 
almost immediately in distributions of LLC income earned after the issuance. At the other extreme, profits interests may not participate until 
the business undertakes an IPO, becomes a target in an acquisition, or experiences some other "exit" event. Other alternatives exist as well, such 
as deferring profits interest participation under other members have received a return of their capital contributions (and perhaps also a 
preferred return). In any event, the timing of the profits interest participation should be explicitly addressed in the entity's operating 
agreement.  

## Are the profits interests subject to vesting restrictions?  

Vesting restrictions present unique issues in the profits interest context, as the applicable IRS guidance assumes profits interests recipients 
are treated as partners/members as of the date of grant. Therefore, entities issuing restricted interests need to address their treatment 
between the dates of grant and vesting. Often, restricted interest holders are not entitled to distributions until the restrictions lapse, or 
such distributions are held in escrow until lapse. Additional attention should be directed to the issue of whether a restricted 
holder should be entitled to tax distributions to offset taxes attributable to the entity's income during the restriction period.  

## Are the profits interest recipients entitled to "catch-up allocations?"  

Many managing partners and LLC managers are surprised to hear that profits interest recipients can share in the overall enterprise value as of 
the interest's grant date. However, in order to avoid a harmful "capital shift," such a profits interest must be structured to receive 
their share of existing value out of the future growth of the enterprise, meaning that the profits interest will participate disproportionately 
until they are "caught up" to their nominal participation percentage. Of course, the operating agreement should clearly express whether the 
profits interest is entitled to such "catch-up allocations." In my experience, however, entity agreements often provide for the opposite treatment 
that the parties anticipated, particularly agreements that use "targeted allocation" provisions.  

## Are the profits interest recipients employees?  

Unfortunately, the tax rules do not permit dual roles as both a partner or LLC member and an employee for tax purposes. Therefore, a profits 
interest recipient may lose their ability to participate in certain employee-benefit programs and must report self-employment taxes (rather than 
having payroll taxes withheld) on all of their entity income, including amounts previously treated as salary. However, the timing of the 
transition from employee to partner/member is not entirely clear, and is likely to be affected by the chosen outcome to the prior options. For 
example, a profits interest holder that is entitled to immediate distributions of operating income would immediately become an equityholder 
with all of their entity income reported on a form K-1. By contrast, the holder of a profits interest that is only entitled to distributions 
on an "exit" event may be able to defer such a transition.  

In conclusion, profits interests can provide a very effective method of incentivizing service providers, but need to be thoughtfully negotiated 
and the entity's agreement needs to be carefully structured in order to ensure that the negotiated business deal is accurately reflected.
