The IRS recently issued [Revenue Procedure 2014-20][rev proc cite], in which it extended certain preferential tax treatment to owners of 
distressed business real estate in a wholly owned LLC that is disregarded for tax purposes. As background, taxpayers are generally subject to 
tax on the amount of any debt they have borrowed that is discharged or otherwise forgiven by the lender. However, a specific exemption from 
tax is provided to certain discharges of debt used to acquire real estate that is used in a trade or business. To qualify, the taxpayer must 
have secured that debt with the applicable real estate.  

Often, taxpayers hold business real estate through a wholly owned LLC "holding company" that is disregarded for tax purposes. Previously, the 
tax rules were not clear on whether the exemption applied where discharged debt was secured by the LLC interests, rather than directly by the 
real estate. However, this IRS guidance explicitly extends this exemption where the loan is secured by the interests in the LLC "holding 
company."  

Taxpayers interested in this exemption should seek professional tax guidance, as the rules regarding its applicability, required election, and 
resulting tax treatment can be very complex. Furthermore, the exemption applies only to real property "used in a trade or business," which could 
exclude many types of investment property.
