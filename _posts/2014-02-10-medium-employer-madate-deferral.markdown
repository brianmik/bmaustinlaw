Yesterday, the Treasury Department [announced] [announcement] that it and the IRS have issued final regulations under the Affordable Care Act 
(ACA). As described by the Treasury, these final regulations delay until January 1, 2016 the requirement that "medium-sized" employers provide 
qualifying healthcare insurance to certain employees, or otherwise incur financial penalties.  

For these purposes, "medium-sized" employers are generally businesses that employ 50-99 full-time employees. (Employers with 49 or less 
employees are generally not required to provide healthcare insurance under the ACA.) These final reguations supercede previously released guidance 
which had deferred the medium-size employer mandate until January 1, 2015. However, medium-size employers may remain subject to certain 
reporting requirements that take effect next year. Affected employers should consider seeking legal guidance on these requirements under 
the ACA, including the detailed rules for defining a "full-time" employee for these purposes.
