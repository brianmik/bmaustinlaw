          <p>Legally, business enterprises are divided into discrete types, such as traditional for-profit companies (corps and LLCs), non-profit associations, and (more rarely) mutual benefit organizations (such as co-ops). I assist clients in navigating between these differing business regimes, or in combining elements of different business forms to create a legal structure that best serves the business and its stakeholders&mdash;for the long term.</p>
          <p class="space-none">In doing so, I guide my clients in considering all relevant factors, including growth of the business enterprise, &ldquo;exits&rdquo; and other transitions, current and future sources of financing, and the roles of employees, service providers, and even customers and other patrons throughout the growth of the venture.</p>

          <p>In 2013, I founded my Austin-based legal practice to serve a Texas and California client base.</p>
          <p class="space-none">Prior to founding this practice, I spent over six years with two large, nationally recognized law firms. At the first, I represented large, often public, businesses, and at the second, I focused on Silicon Valley start-ups and entrepreneurs. I have extensive experience in the tax treatment of business formations, financings and lending transactions, equity compensation, mergers and other acquisitive transactions, divestitures, joint ventures, and cross-border transactions.</p>
