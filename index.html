          <p>I practice transactional law because I enjoy navigating complex business and tax law issues, exploring new transactions, delving into the needs of each party, and identifying new contingencies.</p>
          <p class="space-none">I use both fixed-fee and hourly billing arrangements, where appropriate. Prior to arranging a fee structure I strive to fully understand the business history and unique issues confronted by my clients. Let's talk about helping you build something.</p>

          <p>In 2013, I founded this Austin-based legal practice serving business clients in the Texas and California markets.</p>
          <p class="space-none">Prior to founding this practice I spent over six years with two large, nationally recognized law firms&mdash;one in Chicago, and the other in Silicon Valley. My practice has ranged from providing counsel to &ldquo;garage&rdquo; start&ndash;up entrepreneurs on a shoestring budget, to billion dollar transactions for established businesses.</p>
