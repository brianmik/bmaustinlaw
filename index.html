          <p>I practice transactional law because I enjoy navigating complex business and tax law issues, exploring new transactions, delving into the needs of each party, and identifying new contingencies.</p>
          <p>Prior to arranging a fee structure I strive to fully understand the business history and unique issues confronted by my clients. Let's talk about helping you build something. <a class="uppercase small" href="contact.html">Contact me <i class="fi-at-sign red"></i></a></p>

          <h3 class="uppercase space-none">Experience</h3>
          <p>In 2014 I started my own practice. Prior to founding this practice I spent over six years with two large, nationally recognized law firms&mdash;one in Chicago, and the other in Silicon Valley. My practice has ranged from providing counsel to &ldquo;garage&rdquo; start&ndash;up entrepreneurs on a shoestring budget, to billion dollar transactions for established businesses.</p>
