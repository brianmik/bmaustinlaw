          </header>
          <p>Social enterprises and impact investors work outside the boundaries of traditional business and finance. Conventional legal structures and approaches often fail them. My goal is to help these clients navigate their legal options and maximize their positive social impact.</p>
          <p class="space-none">In doing so, I guide my clients in considering all relevant factors, including growth of the business enterprise, &ldquo;exits&rdquo; and other transitions, current and future sources of financing, and the roles of employees, service providers, and even customers and other patrons throughout the growth of the venture.</p>
